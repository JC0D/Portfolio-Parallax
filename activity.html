          <p><span class="header">Dr. Stone (stylized as Dr.STONE)</span> is a Japanese manga series written by Riichiro Inagaki and illustrated by the South Korean artist Boichi. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from March 2017 to March 2022, with its chapters collected in 26 tankōbon volumes. The story follows Senku Ishigami, a scientific genius who plans to rebuild civilization after humanity was mysteriously petrified for 3,700 year
            In North America, the manga was licensed by Viz Media. Shueisha began to simulpublish the series in English on the website and app Manga Plus in January 2019. An anime television series adaptation produced by TMS Entertainment, aired on Tokyo MX from July to December 2019. Two additional seasons of the anime series have been produced; the second focused on the "Stone Wars" arc aired from January to March 2021, while the third focused on the "New World" arc premiered in April 2023. A television special titled Dr. Stone: Ryusui premiered in July 2022.
            By June 2022, the manga had over 14 million copies in circulation. In 2019, Dr. Stone won the 64th Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen category.
            Director Shinya Iino expressed that one of the challenges with adapting the series into animation was determining how the backgrounds would appear in a different medium. He would go on to state that Boichi had provided his assistance by sending his own rough sketches as a way to facilitate the adaptation process. Iino would also state that the theme of science featured in the manga captured his attention to the series as it wasn't a theme that was featured in many other shonen series.</p>
